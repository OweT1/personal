Hi there! I am Owen, a current Year 3 student studying Data Science and Analytics & a 2nd major in Computer Science here at National University of Singapore (NUS)!

My personal repository containing some of the things that I have done in the past! These include some assessments, projects as well as reviews of the modules that I have taken thus far during my time in school.
