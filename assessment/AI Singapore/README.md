# AI Singapore Internship Technical Assessment

I did not apply for the internship, this technical assessment was sent to me by a friend (Mr Sean Koh), and I wanted to give it a shot since this was my first application of the machine learning skills I picked up from completing AI Singapore's Foundations in AI course.
