# AI Singapore Batch 2 Internship Technical Assessment

I did not apply for the internship, but the technical assessment was sent to me by a friend (Mr Sean Koh), and I wanted to give it a shot since this was my first application of the machine learning skills I picked up from completing AI Singapore's Foundations in AI course.

Key Performance Metric: Accuracy

The models used in the assessment were:
| No. | Model                           | Accuracy (%) |
|:---:|---------------------------------|:------------:|
| 1   | Logistic Regression             | 71.85        |
| 2   | Random Forest                   | 72.93        |
| 3   | Neural Network                  | 72.85        |

The Random Forest Classifier was the most accurate model with an accuracy rate of 72.93%.
