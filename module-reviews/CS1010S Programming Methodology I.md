# CS1010S Programming Methodology I
## Taken in AY22/23 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Ashish

Assessment Mode:
- Coursemology (15%)
- Tutorial Participation (5%)
- Practical Exam (15%)
- Mid-terms (20% or 0% with progressive scoring)
- Finals (40% or 60% with progressive scoring)

Rumored as the toughest module to take, I thought it would be really tough. At the end, I felt that it was tough but definitely doable if you are consistent in completing all your missions and content. It also helped that I took a Introduction to Python course in SMU back in JC so I did not even watch the lectures at all, instead I just did the exercises, which was a good refresher for the syntax in Python. Given that, it was definitely still a struggle to do some of the missions, so do try to do it with your friends if possible.

However, I am aware that the content for AY23/24 was cut short, so the module may not be as tough anymore, so that's a good thing!

Workload: 7/10
Difficulty: 6/10
Enjoyability: 6/10

### Coursemology - 15/15:
Graded linearly depending on your Coursemology level out of 50. Usually most people would get level 50 in week 10/11, but you can definitely get it much earlier (week 7/8) if you complete your missions early and unlock the future missions earlier.

### Tutorial Participation - 4.5 or 5 (I can't remember)/5:
Just participate and you should be good to go. I think this semester was much more lenient in terms of grading, I know some people who said that they didn't get a high tutorial participation in the previous semester even though they participated in class.

### Practical Exam - 18.5/20:
4 Questions, 1 Recursive/Iterative question, 1 Filtering/Mapping Question and 2 OOP Questions. They tried a new format this time round by installing Safe Exam Browser and doing the Exam on our own laptops instead (last semester everyone would go to the labs and use the computers there to do the exam). Practice as many questions as you can to score well.

### Mid-terms - 55/60:
Can't remember the content tested, nor would it be relevant now. But just practice as many PYPs as you can and you should be good to go!

### Finals - 93/100:
Same as Mid-terms.

Expected Grade: A/A+
Actual Grade: A+
