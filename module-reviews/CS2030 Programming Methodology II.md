# CS2030 Programming Methodology II

## Taken in AY24/25 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Henry Chia, Prof Wei Ngan

TA: Matthew and Mak

### Assessment Mode:

- Labs, Self-practice exercises, class participation & peer learning activities (10%)
- Individual Project (15%)
- Practical Assignment #1 (15%)
- Practical Assignment #2 (20%)
- Finals (40%)

The standard module to learning more about OOP, Functional Programming, Concurrency etc. Quite a good informative module that goes through all the foundations and basics of these concepts, but has a rather high workload with weekly lectures, recitations, lab sessions and multiple programming exercises that contribute to the grade. Nonetheless, it was an interesting course and it should be taken by those who are interested in Computer Science.

Workload: 8/10

Difficulty: 8/10

Enjoyability: 4/10

### Labs, Self-practice exercises, class participation & peer learning activities - ?/10:
Basically just attend all the classes there are.

### Individual Project - 13-14(?)/15:
The horror that is the Individual Project (Discrete Event Simulator). Thankfully, it has been heavily nerfed over the previous iterations (what was considered mandatory before is considered as optional now), so it was not actually too bad, but definitely the time and effort spent on this was still rather high. There were quite a few learning points when doing this project, so I would say that the effort was worth it. Personally, I did not complete it (passed 10/11 TCs) as I felt that it was not worth the time and effort required to fix my code for the last test case, so I left it as it is. Hopefully that does not bite me back later on...

### Practical Assignment #1 - 12.8/15:
Tested more on the OOP side of things. Generally okay, I did not get the final implementation right but managed to get the first 2/3 levels to work. With enough practice of past PAs, this should not be too difficult to score well.

### Practical Assignment #2 - 17/20:
Tested more on Generics and Functional Programming. I felt that it was okay as I focused fully on the code logic rather than any syntax errors, which netted a pretty good score.

### Finals - ?/40:
A rather unfortunate string of events that led to the delaying of the exam by half an hour, nonetheless I found the exam to be okay (with minimal studying). Hopefully it will show in my actual grade...
