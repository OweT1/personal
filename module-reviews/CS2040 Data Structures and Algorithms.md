As part of the Holy Trinity in Computer Science (CS2030/CS2030S, CS2040/CS2040S, CS2100), I thought the module was definitely on a higher workload than others, as we had to learn Java Programming completely during the 1st week of the module, and afterwards learn the lecture content about the various Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science. And the worse part is the lecture content is really hard to grasp cause of the nature of the content, and so consistent reading and practice is crucial in order to do well in this module. That being said, there are many opportunities to apply some of the concepts learnt during the module through the One-day Assignments and Take-Home Assignments, so it is more about being able to turn the content into a program that works to solve the various problems.

Workload: 8/10

Difficulty: 8/10

Enjoyability: 5/10

### Tutorial Attendance - Not Released/5:
Rather simple, just need to attend tutorial and participate. Grading is dependent on the TA so I guess it is a bit luck dependent? My TA would call names to answer the tutorial questions, then he would mark our names accordingly.

### One-day Assignments - 15/15:
There were 10 One-day Assignments, 1 each week from Week 2 to Week 13. The One-day Assignments' difficulties vary based on the content for that week, some were really easy, while some can be challenging. Again, being consistent is key to doing these problems as the questions will require the lectures' content to solve.

### Take-Home Assignments - 12/12:
There were 4 Take-Home Assignments, 2 questions each. These were basically harder ODAs and will take you a while to solve. More often than not, these questions require your method to be very fast (more strict than your ODAs) and hence that is the main issue with these questions, as you really need to know what your code is doing to identify the areas that can be further optimised to pass the test cases. That being said, discussing with friends would be really helpful in this aspect, but do take note of any possible plagarism, as they will take it quite seriously.

### Visualgo Quizzes - 8/8: 
2 Visualgo quizzes, 1 during Week 7 Lab session (day before Midterms) and 1 during Week 13 Lab session. These are easy, just need to spend some time to grind through the visualgo quizzes and create a cheatsheet. More or less depends on your overall effort, most people would score pretty well so you need to work hard for this component.

### Midterms - 55/75:
I thought Midterms were tough but doable, definitely very tricky and requires you to thoroughly grasp the concepts taught in the 1st half well. Open book but still requires you to understand before you can apply the concepts, so lots of practice on the PYPs would serve you well in answering the questions. I personally went through close to 10+ PYPs, so definitely doing more would help. The Upper Quartile was only 36/75, which was worse than expected.

### Finals - 84/100:
Again, I feel that Finals were tough but definitely doable. The content was definitely harder, but again, consistent effort will help you in grasping the concepts. Similar to Midterms, doing a lot of PYPs will get you familiar with the type of questions asked. The upper quartile was 59/100, so more people did well for this component.

#### Expected Grade: A/A+
