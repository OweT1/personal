Was warned to not take this module by my CS friends but took it anyways. Luckily I took it as I need to for my second major, and honestly it wasn't as bad as I thought it to be. Definitely, expect the workload to be insane for this module, as there are weekly pre-recorded videos to watch, canvas quizzes, live recitations, weekly labs and tutorial sessions, which made this module one of the most loaded modules I have taken thus far. That being said, I did enjoy doing the module as the content was quite interesting and satisfied my interest in Computer Science, even though the topics were very new and difficult to grasp. I also strongly discourage you taking this module with more intensive modules, as this module can be very time-consuming if you want to do well in it.

Workload: 9/10

Difficulty: 8/10

Enjoyability: 5/10

### Tutorial - 5/5:
Just attend the tutorial sessions are you are good to go.

### Canvas Quizzes - 3/3:
Weekly Canvas Quizzes for the content that week. There are pre-recorded videos for each topic that we are expected to watch, thereafter we will complete the quizzes before the weekly recitations on Monday.

### Assignments	- Almost 12/12:
3 Assignments, 4% each. Relatively simple as long as you follow the content, though there were some tough questions. Most people got close to full marks, so doing this with your friends would help you get close to full marks for this component.

### Labs - Almost 10/10:
Weekly labs, where you mostly do the lab work before the lab itself. The lab session is just for you to submit your work to the TA, except for those sessions where you need to play with the circuits in the classroom. The labs were 

### Midterms - 29/40:
Midterms were definitely on the tougher side, even with PYPs. I felt that I did badly, especially for the last question (got 2/10), which showed in my overall marks. Upper quartile was 27.5/40, which was quite high and I felt that I could have done a lot better if I understood what the last question was about.

### Finals - 76/100
Was very scared for the finals paper given my low confidence for the last few topics. Doing a lot of PYPs helped a bit but not a lot, as I was often wrong for those questions anyways. Ended doing fine for those topics and fell behind for the topics before Midterms. Could have done a lot better if I wasn't careless but it is what it is.

#### Expected Grade: A
