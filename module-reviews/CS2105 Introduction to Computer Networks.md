Dropped the module in recess week due to heavy workload.

The content in the 1st half of the semester was taught by Prof Wai Kay, and the 2nd half taught by Prof Jithin.

The content was rather digestable due to the teaching mode, but it felt that a lot of concepts were not being elaborated on enough (which were thoroughly tested on for the midterms). Hence, reading of external content/concepts may be required to do well in this module.
