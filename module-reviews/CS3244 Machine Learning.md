Good module to take to learn more about the field of Machine Learning. First half of the semester (Mainly about kNN, Decision Trees, Regularisation and Overfitting) was taught by Prof Wee Sun, and the second half (about Model Evaluation, Data/Feature Engineering, Neural Networks, CNN, RNN etc) was taught by Prof Wang Ye. I found the content of the lectures to be rather digestible yet detailed, with the mathematics behind the various models being shown and briefly explained, though it was not the main focus of the course. Generally enjoyed this module, as it was rather low workload with only 1 assignment in the 1st half of the semester, and the group project for the 2nd half of the semester.

Workload: 6/10

Difficulty: 7/10

Enjoyability: 9/10

### Attendance & Participation - ?/10:
Basically just need to participate in the lecture's Archipalego, and attend most of the tutorials to secure the full 10 marks.

### Assignment 1 - 9.4/10:
Implementation of the various mechanisms of kNN and Decision Trees from scratch, as well as some explaination questions. Non-differentiating.

### Group Project - ?/25:
Basically a Machine Learning project where we can tackle any problem that we want to do. We took on Quora Question Pairs, which is basically about the detection of similar Quora questions. Project timeline is very simple, just required to submit a project proposal sometime during Week 8-9, update on our progress throughout and then submit our final project code and group presentation (15mins max) by the end of week 13. If you have experience with implementing of ML models on python, the project is very doable.

### Midterms - 15/20:
Tested on 1st half of the semester. Generally okay, but can be quite tricky as there are a few MRQs (with no partial marking).

### Finals - ?/35:
Tested on the whole semester. Would say that it was quite underwhelming, given that it was 24 questions (mostly MCQ, with some fill-in-the-blank questions), but would not say that I would do super well for it.
