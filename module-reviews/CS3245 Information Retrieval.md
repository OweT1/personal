Professor: Prof Zhao Jin

TA: Prof Zhao Jin

### Assessment Mode:

- Class Participation (5%)
- Weekly Quizzes (5%)
- Homework Assignments (40%)
- Finals (50%)

A rather interesting module that goes through the basics of Information Retrieval (yes, I know), primarily how we can rank documents retrieved using a query consisting of several indexing and querying techniques, and ending off with Web Crawling and Link Analysis (aka Markov Chains). What made this course stand out was the Prof and his enthusiasm to teach us during lectures and tutorials. Would definitely recommend this module if you are interested in the fundamentals of text searching, and that it is a moderate workload with biweekly tutorial sessions and 4 homework assignments.

Workload: 7/10

Difficulty: 6/10

Enjoyability: 9/10

### Class Participation - 5/5:
As there were only 5 tutorial sessions for the module, we will earn 1% for each tutorial that we present in. Alternatively, participating in the Ed forums will contribute to this component as well.

### Weekly Quizzes - 5/5:
Takes the best 10 out of 12 quizzes. Generally, the quizzes are pretty simple as long as you follow the lecture content closely. Eitherways, this component is awarded on a best-effort basis, so as long as you were close enough to full marks, you will get it.

### Homework Assignments - ?/40:
Made up of 4 assignments:
- Assignment 1 - 5/5 (Individual)
- Assignment 2 - 9.1/10 (Pair)
- Assignment 3 - 9.4/10 (Pair)
- Assignment 4 - ?/15 (Group)

Assignments are generally doable, requiring us to implement the various techniques taught in lectures. We are able to pair up for Assignments 2 and 3, and group up for Assignment 4, so this component's workload will vary depending on your pair/groupmates.

### Finals - ?/50:
I think this year's finals was harder (could be just me...), given that the application questions were tougher as compared to the previous years' papers (our questions were extensions of what we learnt in class, whereas previous papers followed the lecture content more closely, with easier calculation questions). Nonetheless, the paper was okay and was definitely doable with sufficient preparation.
