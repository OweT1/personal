# CS4225 Big Data Systems for Data Science

## Taken in AY25/26 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Bryan Hooi & Prof Ai Xin
TA: Desmond

### Assessment Mode:

- Assignments (50%)
- Finals (50%)

A decent, extremely low workload module that teaches about Big Data Systems, including concepts like Data Centers, MapReduce, Databases, Spark, Flink etc are covered, which are relatively useful for anyone wanting to go into Tech.
Overall pretty enjoyable and digestable content.

Workload: 2/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 8/10

### Assignments - 46 (25/25 + 21/25)/50:

2 Assignments - 1 about MapReduce and 1 about Spark & Machine Learning.
Pretty do-able and simple, and more or less everyone gets full marks for both assignments (I didn't really bother that much).

### Finals - ?/50:

Tested about all the concepts taught throughout the semester.
If you do all the PYPs, you will get a feel of what will come out during Finals, where some of the questions will have similar patterns.

#### Expected Grade: B+/A-

#### Actual Grade: A
