# DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science
## Taken in AY22/23 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Pham Kim Cuc, Daisy

Assessment Mode:
- Tutorial Attendance (5%)
- Datacamp Assignments (5%)
- Midterms (30%)
- Finals (60%)

We were the "guinea pig" batch as this was the first semester that Prof Daisy took this module. There were no individual tutorial sessions back then as the tutorial was right after the 1 hour lecture on Friday 8am-9am, though I am aware that now there are such sessions, which is a good thing. Overall, I feel that the module was well structured, giving us a detailed overview of the various concepts that we will learn about again later on in CS3244 Machine Learning.

Workload: 1/10
Difficulty: 3/10
Enjoyability: 6/10

Tutorial Attendance- 4.5/5:
Just attend the in-lecture tutorial session and you are good to go.

Datacamp Assignments - 5/5:
We just had to do some simple courses on Datacamp with R as the main programming language. Should not take too long if you know what you are doing

Midterms - 69/80:
I felt that the midterms was manageable, though many people did not find it so (median & mean was around 40ish). If you do enough practice with the lecture material, you should do fine.

Finals - Not released:
Again, I felt that the finals was manageable as long as you prepare thoroughly enough (have a good cheatsheet). I was able to complete the exam in 1h 30mins, giving me 30mins to check through my answers. You can also "spot" the things she will test if you listen to the lectures attentively enough (she hinted on finding AUC values for all the models, which was what we did in the finals for the various classifiers)

Expected Grade: A/A+
Actual Grade: A+
