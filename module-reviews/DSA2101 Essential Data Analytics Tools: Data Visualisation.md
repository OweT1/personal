# DSA2101 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation
## Taken in AY23/24 Semester 2

Professor: Huang Yuting

TA: Clara Koh

### Assessment Mode:
- Tutorial Attendance (5%)
- Datacamp Assignments (10%)
- Group Project (15%)
- Midterms (30%)
- Finals (40%)

Quite an interesting follow-up to DSA1101, we got to learn more about R and how we can use it to clean, analyse and visualise our data using the `tidyverse` package. While it was quite interesting to learn, it was rather useless since companies usually don't use R for anything. However, the concepts definitely carry over to other programming languages like Python (using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), so it was still rather useful.

Workload: 3/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 7/10

### Tutorial Attendance - 5(probably)/5:
Just attend tutorial and take attendance, plain and simple. I found the sessions to be rather useless, so I would just do other stuff during the tutorial time. The tutor was just reading off the slides, so I felt that it was better to do other stuff instead. Was not able to verify my marks.

### Datacamp Assignments - 10(probably)/10:
Some simple Datacamp courses related to the module content. Quite simple, just need to spend a few hours to do them. Was not able to verify my marks.

### Group Project - 12.25/15:
Group up in 2-5 members and complete a group project using 1 out of 5 datasets. The group project consists of data cleaning, analysing and lastly visualisation with 3 different plots. The group project is rather simple and can be completed alone, but it is definitely easier with group mates who will do the work as well.

### Midterms - 30/30:
Midterms was quite standard, as long as you follow through the tutorial well, the midterms should be quite simple to complete. It simply consisted of simple data manipulation and cleaning, as well as simple data visualisations.

### Finals - Not Released/40:
Finals was also quite standard. You just need to follow the lecture content and tutorial well to know what the Prof will test. The MCQ portion can be Ctrl + F in her notes, while for the open-ended questions, a good cheatsheet will help you do well, since you can just copy and paste the graphs over. I used the plots that the Prof showed in the lectures since they are what the Prof used to show as a good example of a visualisation.
