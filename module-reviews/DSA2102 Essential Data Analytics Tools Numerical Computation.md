# DSA2102 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Numerical Computation
## Taken in AY23/24 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Tim Wertz

TA: Not very sure

### Assessment Mode:
- Homework (20%)
- Midterms (30%)
- Finals (50%)

Overall an alright module. A lot of Linear Algebra in the content, so it is really important to have strong fundamentals in this area (which I did not have). The Prof was really nice to our questions and honestly I liked him as a Lecturer. The content was dry at times, but I think the prof really tried his best to break it down and make it a bit more engaging for us. Would definitely recommend taking modules under Prof Tim Wertz.

Workload: 5/10

Difficulty: 6/10

Enjoyability: 4/10

### Homework - Close to full marks/20:
4 Homeworks, 50 marks each (5% each). The Prof was nice and also tried to encourage Lecture Attendance by giving the option of overriding the lowest marks homework with lecture attendance instead (Eg if you got 40/50 on 1 of the homework but you attended all the lectures, the marks of this homework would become 50/50 instead, prorated on lecture attendance). Overall the homeworks were doable, with 1-2 R Programming questions in each homework. Most people got close to full marks for the homeworks so definitely doing it with your friends will help to boost this component.

### Midterms - 49/50:
Midterms were manageable, as long as you are able to do all the tutorial questions. The prof marks more on the method rather than the final answer, so even though you may not get the final answers, you will still get a substantial amount of marks from your workings as long as they are reasonable.

## Finals - Not Released/50:
Finals were rather simple, with 1 unorthodox question at the front to "throw you off". As long as you understood the concepts taught in the lectures, as well as some practice with the PYPs set by this Prof, you should be good to go.
