A good module that teaches the fundamentals of Data Science. The lectures were done well, but it was a pity that there were only 5 lectures. It would have been nice if there were more lectures so that we could learn more. The workload of this module will depend very drastically based on your groupmates, so choose them wisely...

Workload: 8/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 6/10

### Class Participation - ?/5:
Just need to attend the lectures that are required to attend (roadshow, fireside chat etc) and finish the various tasks on time (roadshow review etc).

### Datacamp Assignments - 5/5:
Simple Datacamp courses regarding Git, Docker, SQL etc. 

### Quiz - ?/25:
A quiz regarding various data science concepts. Generally, if you know what Data Science is all about (lifecycle, technicals), then this quiz should be rather simple. The only thing that was difficult was understanding what the Prof wanted for his answers.

### Group Project - ?/50:
Broken into 3 parts: Project Success (30%), Video Presentation (10%), Wiki (10%).

I think our group project was rather interesting, which led to the learning of many new technologies which was quite nice. My contributions was a bit more sparse, as I would contribute to wherever was required from frontend to backend.

### Peer Reviews + Contribution - ?/15:
Decided by your group mates! Just do the work and this will be fine.

#### Expected Grade: A

#### Actual Grade: B+
