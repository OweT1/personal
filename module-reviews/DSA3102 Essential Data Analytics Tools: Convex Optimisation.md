# DSA3102 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Convex Optimisation
## Taken in AY24/25 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Lam Xin Yee

TA: Not sure

### Assessment Mode:
- Weekly Quizzes (5%)
- Assignments (15%)
- Midterms (25%)
- Finals (55%)

One of the last "math" modules to be taken as a DSA student. Builds on your foundations of Linear Algebra, Multi-variable Calculus and some programming knowledge as well.
The content can be a bit difficult at times but do take the time to review the content and you should do well. 
The weekly quizzes and timely assignments help you to do this, so as long as you keep up with them, the content will get better.
Live lectures were not recorded, but Prof Xin Yee was really nice and actually did pre-recorded videos of the content, which will be released once the live lectures end every Thursday 7pm-10pm.
Overall, I think Prof Xin Yee is one of the better math professors out there and definitely take this module under her if you have the chance to!

Workload: 7/10

Difficulty: 7/10

Enjoyability: 3/10

### Weekly Quizzes - 5/5:
1 Quiz every week from week 2, where the top 8 quiz scores will be taken to form this component. 
Everyone will basically get these 5 marks; just need to keep up with the content weekly and having friends will definitely help.

### Assignments - 13-14(?)/15:
2 Homework, 1 Computer assignments.
Homework assignments are relatively simple and comparable to tutorial questions.
Computer assignment required us to calculate the loss function for Logistic Regression after k iterations using both Steepest Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods.
Again, keeping up with the content and having friends to compare the answers will really help for this component to get full marks.
Homework 1 and Computer Assignment were both 50/50, but Homework 2 marks were not released, though it is most definitely not full marks.

### Midterms - 46/50:
UQ - 37/50, High - 48/50
Relatively easy as the content tested was rather simple. Made a careless mistake, which costed the 4 marks. 

### Finals - ??/100:
If anything, the paper had the same structure as the PYP provided, except that the questions were non-standard and much more difficult.
The meme below perfectly represents how I felt as I was doing the paper:
