# DSA4213 Natural Language Processing for Data Science

## Taken in AY25/26 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Zhou Doudou

TA: -

### Assessment Mode:

- Class Participation (5%)
- Assignments (30%)
- Quizzes (20%)
- Group Project (45%)

An in-depth module that teaches all the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing. Very interesting module, though it was Prof Zhou Doudou's first time teaching this module (adapted from ST5230), so the assessment modes were quite versatile and changed to 3 quizzes instead of 2 midway through the semester.
Nonetheless, the module still is quite useful, but definitely of a decently high workload given the regular assignments, quizzes and project.

Workload: 9/10

Difficulty: 9/10

Enjoyability: 6/10

### Class Participation - 0/5:

Need to attend the lectures to ask questions etc for class participation.

### Assignments - 26-28 (10/10 + 8/10 + ?/10)/30:

3 Assignments - 1 for training Embedding models; 1 for training Language models (using RNN/LSTM/Transformers); 1 for fine-tuning a Transformer model (BERT).
Generally doable, but it would be disadvantageous if you do not have access to any decent compute resources, since you are required to train models which will take a while.

### Quizzes - 15.125(9/10 + 15/20 + 6.25/10)/20:

3 Closed-book Quizzes about the lecture content.
A good and bad thing about this is that the quizzes are purely based off lecture content, so if you study very hard for it, you will do well.
Personally found it a waste of time to study so hard to memorise, so just did the bare minimum, but could definitely do better if I studied.
A side note - This was one of the aspects you could 'cheat' on, since there was little supervision on the Closed-book part.

### Group Project - ?/45:

Broken into 3 parts: Proposal Report (10%), Final Report (25%), Presentation (10%).

Group Project is to be done in groups of 1-4, and you can basically do anything under the sun that is related to Natural Language Processing.
Personally did stuff related to Vision Language Models for Data Annotation, which was accepted as a project as well.
We were given $100 worth of compute resource credits on Ronin, but we found it to be insufficient for our project, likely due to the nature of our project and that images would generally take longer compared to text data.
As long as the project was something practical and interesting, you should be able to do decently well for a B+ grade hopefully.

#### Expected Grade: B+/A-

#### Actual Grade: B+
