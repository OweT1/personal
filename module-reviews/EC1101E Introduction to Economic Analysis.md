Took this module out of interest. I found the first part about microeconomics (taught by Prof Ong Ee Cheng) to be very similar to the content we learnt in H2 Economics, hence the first part was quite simple. However, once it got to the content after Midterms, which was about macroeconomics (taught by Prof Chan Kok Hoe) I was absolutely clueless and was struggling to complete the weekly problem sets. Hence, it is definitely a tough gateway module for Economics, and I heard that future Economics modules are not as tough, which turns out to be true. Take this if you have strong interest in Economics, and not for fun if you want to do well in the module.

Workload: 5/10

Difficulty: 7/10

Enjoyability: 3/10

### LumiNUS Quizzes - 10/10:
Rather simple, just watch the pre-recorded videos every week and complete the weekly quizzes to get the full credit. Not too difficult.

### Problem Set Submissions - Not Released/5:
Group up in 2 or 3 students in your tutorial class and submit the problem sets weekly before your tutorial class. Again, the problem sets are set to be tricky but doable as long as you put in the effort. However, after midterms, I found the problem sets to be very tough, and more often than not we were wrong in our submissions. Thankfully, the submissions are based off effort, so this component's grading is unknown.

### Tutorial Attendance and Participation - Not Released/10:
Just need to attend and participate in the tutorial. The grading will differ from TA to TA, my TA took attendance and took note of those who went up to write and present the answers to the class. But in the end, she revealed that she will give credit as long as you listen attentively in class, so I am unsure of my grading for this component.

### Midterms - 69/120:
I honestly felt that the midterms was simple and doable, so I was definitely shocked when I received this score. It turned out that the last question about exchange rates, which was worth 18m, I reversed my calculations (instead of multiplying, I divided, and vice versa). Hence I got a full 0 marks for this, which was extremely disappointing on my end. If I had gotten this question right, I would have been in the top 10% of the cohort (95th percentile was 89/120), but some things just aren't meant to be.

### Finals - Not Released/180:
I thought Finals were alright and did not have much thoughts on it. I felt that I did my best in preparing for the exam (there were no PYPs, only mock quizzes released by the profs), so I couldn't have done more to prepare myself.
