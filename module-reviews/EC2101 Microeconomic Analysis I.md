The follow-up to EC1101E, I took this module for my then-minor in Economics. Overall, I found the content to be rather simple; the first half was roughly about the optimisation of resources in the micro level (Prices etc), and the second half was about the optimisation of resources in the macro-level instead (think Labour, Capital etc). I definitely felt that this was easier than EC1101E, as it was more focused at the Microeconomic side of Economics, which I thought was easier than Macroeconomics.

Workload: 5/10

Difficulty: 3/10

Enjoyability: 6/10

### Canvas Quizzes - 7.5/7.5:
There are pre-recorded lecture videos that we will watch weekly and then we will have to complete the relevant quizzes before the weekly lecture covering that content. Basically full marks as long as you are consistent. 

### Weekly Problem Set Submissions - Not Released/7.5:
Group up in groups of 2 or 3 in your tutorial slot and complete the weekly problem sets before your tutorial class. Unsure of how I performed but we were assured that as long as we put in the effort to complete the questions, we will get the credit.

### Lectures & Tutorials Participation - Not Released/15:
Not sure how this was graded, as my TA (somehow my CS1010S TA as well) was quite chill and just marked attendanced. Lecture-wise, Prof Ee Cheng likes to do PollEV during lectures to gauge your Lecture Participation so you need to either attend the in-person lecture / have a friend attend the in-person lecture / refresh the PollEV page every 5-10 minutes to catch the PollEV.

### Midterms - 104/105:
I thought the Midterms was rather alright in terms of the Prof's standards, MCQ was 48 marks while the rest of the marks were allocated to Open Ended Questions. Miraculously got full marks for my MCQ and almost full marks for the 2nd section (-1 mark for not drawing a line...). I think this was my peak in Economics as Prof Ee Cheng even emailed me to congratulate me and ask me to consider converting my then-minor in Economics to a major.

### Finals - Not Released/120:
I did not study so hard for Finals and hence I thought the paper was rather difficult, with a lot of weird questions, though I would say that this is simply a Prof Ee Cheng paper. I walked out of the exam hall discussing with my friend and I felt quite discouraged as his answers were different from mine.
