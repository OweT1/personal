# IT2002 Database Technology and Management

## Taken in AY24/25 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Adi Yoga 

TA: Not very sure

### Assessment Mode:

- Assignments (20%)
- Group Project (20%)
- Test 1 (30%)
- Test 2 (30%)

Good module to learn about databases and stuff. I felt that the first half of the content (mainly SQL queries and joins, etc) was much easier as compared to the second half (stored triggers, procedures, database normalisation, functional dependencies), but overall the course was rather manageable, though the workload may vary depending on your group for the group project. It definitely helps to have friends taking the module with you, since a good part of the grade (40%) are based on assignments and group projects. This would probably be considered a 'simpler' version of CS2102, which covers roughly the same content as well (since it is taught by a CS2102 prof).

Workload: 7/10

Difficulty: 6/10

Enjoyability: 6/10

### Assignments - 20/20:
2 Assignments, 1 mainly focused on SQL queries, and 1 focused on Functional Dependencies and Normalisation. The 2nd assignment is definitely a lot trickier and tougher, but it really helps to have friends to discuss answers with etc.

### Group Project - 13/20:
A group project split into 3 components: Creation of Database Tables, Creation of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and Creation of Stored Procedures and Triggers. It should be fine as long as you have groupmates who know what is going on with this module.

Breakdown: 4.5/5, 3/5, 5.5/10

### Test 1 - 26.5/30:
Tested mainly on Entity Relationship Diagram and SQL querying. SQL querying is rather simple, the 'harder' portion would be understanding the ERD and learning how to read it. Overall, it was okay.

### Test 2 - 21.5/30:
Tested mainly on Database Normalisation and Functional Dependencies. I felt that it was doable and understandable, but 1 or 2 simple mistakes can cost you a lot of marks, which happened to be the case this time round.

#### Expected Grade: B+/A- (81/100)

#### Actual Grade: TBC
