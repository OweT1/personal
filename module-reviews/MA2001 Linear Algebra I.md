# MA2001 Linear Algebra I
## Taken in AY22/23 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Dilip Raghavan, Prof Ma Siu Lun

TA: Not sure

Assessment Mode:
- LumiNUS Quiz (15%) (12 quizzes, majority 10 MCQ questions)
- Homework (20%) (4 Homeworks, 5% each)
- MATLAB Assignment (5%)
- Finals (60%)

I initially found the module to be doable. But I think after the first 3 chapters, I was unable to understand much of the content and struggled heavily with the content, especially with the proving aspect of the module. I was only able to consistently do calculation questions, but other than that, I was unable to do much of the proving, which was a crucial aspect of this module. I am thankful to have taken this module with friends, since we can check with one another regarding the quiz, homeworks and assignments, which made this module much more bearable.

Workload: 4/10

Difficulty: 8/10

Enjoyability: 2/10

### LumiNUS Quiz - Almost 15/15:
It consisted of 12 weekly quizzes on LumiNUS containing a few questions each. The quizzes were simply testing the content taught during the lectures, but even then they were rather tricky.

### Homework - Almost 20/20:
It consisted of 4 Homeworks, 50 marks (5%) each. They were set in regular intervals, so the homeworks would test a few chapters of content each time. Again, I was very lucky to do this with my friends, as they really helped to make sure that the answers were correct.

### MATLAB Assignment - 5/5:
A simple assignment with the use of MATLAB to do some calculations. Much more straightforward compared to the homeworks, and most people would get full marks for this component.

### Finals - Not Released/60:
The paper consisted of 6 questions, 4 calculation questions and 2 proving questions. The calculation questions were rather straightforward, while the proving questions are not as straightforward, though I am sure that someone else who is good at proving would be able to solve these questions. I did not have much thoughts about it, as I felt that I did my best already and had solved the 4 calculation questions and 1 proving question (though I may have gotten some questions wrong due to my final grade).
