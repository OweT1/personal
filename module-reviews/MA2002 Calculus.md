# MA2002 Calculus
## Taken in AY22/23 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Jonathon Teo, Prof Tran Chieu Minh

TA: Not sure

### Assessment Mode:
- Canvas Quizzes (15%)

- Midterms (15%)
- Finals (40%)

I thought the module was rather tough at first, especially with the epsilon-delta stuff being taught in week 3/4. Even when I thought I understood the concept, it turns out that I actually don't, which was really demoralising at times. The content after midterms were also really tough at first, but after some time, it was easier to grasp. Doing this with friends would help for the quizzes and homeworks, but that would be it. Prof Jonathon was a really good lecturer and taught the content well, which was a good thing.

Workload: 5/10

Difficulty: 6/10

Enjoyability: 6/10

### Canvas Quizzes - 100/100:
They took the best 10 quizzes out of 12 (I believe), so doing this with friends will really help to do well for this component. As long as you followed the lecture content closely, the quizzes were rather straightforward and heavily tested your concepts and calculation skills.

### Homework - Almost 30/30:
There were 3 homeworks, 40 marks (10%) each. The homework were basically harder tutorial questions, but were still doable as long as you knew the lecture content. Again, doing this with friends would really help with cross checking the answers and getting close to full marks for this component.

### Midterms - 82/100:
Midterms was basically 20 4m questions and 2 10m questions. The paper was well set in terms of the difficulty, as it was rather doable so long as you followed the content closely and are very meticulous with your calculations. I prepared by doing lots of PYPs, which was very demoralising at times as the questions in the PYP were really tough. After seeing the results, although it was well above the upper quartile, I felt that I could have done better for this component, but oh wells.

### Finals - Not Released/100:
The finals was quite standard, you just have to grasp the concepts and practice enough. With enough PYPs, and you would probably have seen the questions in the Finals paper before, and it would help with doing the calculations without any careless mistakes.
