# MA2311 Techniques in Advanced Calculus
## Taken in AY23/24 Semester 1

Professor: Prof Leung Man Chun

TA: Not sure

### Assessment Mode:
- Midterms (20%)
- Finals (80%)

I was looking forward to this module, but then after going for a few lectures, I quickly realised that the lectures were a joke. I learnt nothing for the first half of the semester, as the content were already covered in previous modules / MA2002. For the second half, the content was much more difficult, and even though the Prof Leung Man Chun tried to simplify the content for us, I think the content was still really hard to digest, and most people probably gave up trying for the module.

A good thing about the module was that watching the lectures were not really "work"; I watched the lectures to destress from my other modules as the Prof was just that funny and enjoyable to watch, so I thoroughly enjoyed the module just because of his personality.

Workload: 2/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 10/10

### Midterms - 18/20:
The midterms were quite simply a joke. I mean the questions are basically recycled questions from his tutorials, and if you have the PYP (that he set, not other profs), you would definitely see the similarity in questions. It was conducted in LT26, and as you can imagine, the LT is too small for adequate spacing between people. Hence, people could easily cheat by looking at each other's answers, or some people may even access the internet under the desks and not get caught if they were stealthy enough. Overall, it was a mess and was not well conducted by the Prof.

### Finals - Not Released/100:
The finals were a disaster. The questions were either too easy or too difficult, and even though the questions were already "expected", it was still too hard to complete as the content was just difficult to digest. I probably only got half the paper correct, and the other half probably had some method marks awarded, but overall I felt that I didn't do well and could have done better.
