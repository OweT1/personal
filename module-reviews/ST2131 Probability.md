# ST2131 Probability
## Taken in AY22/23 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Chan Yiu Man
TA: Can't remember

### Assessment Mode:
- Canvas Quizzes (20%)
- Midterms (20%)
- Finals (60%)

I thought that the module was rather alright, going through the basics of probability, which would be familiar for those who took H2 Math in JC before. As someone who is weak in statistics in general, I felt that this module was tough for me, as I struggled to grasp some of the concepts, especially in the second half of the module.

Workload: 2/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 2/10

### Canvas Quizzes - 19/20:
4 Canvas Quizzes, 5 questions each (1 mark each). Rather straightforward if you follow through with the lecture content well, but doing it with friends will definitely help you get full marks / close to full marks.

### Midterms - 29/30:
Midterms was rather simple, as the content in the first half was simple in general. Rather steep curve as most people would have scored >20 marks on the paper.

### Finals - Not Released/100:
I thought the Finals was ok, but I was upset as he basically recycled textbook questions and put in on the paper. From my experience, 2 out of 6 questions were copied directly from the textbook, 1 of which was easy to complete, the other was way tougher (I couldn't understand the answer key given). Overall, I could have done way better but then again, I felt that I had done my best to prepare for the exam and I was simply not in the right state of mind to take the finals (had CS1010S Finals earlier in the morning & did not eat afterwards)
