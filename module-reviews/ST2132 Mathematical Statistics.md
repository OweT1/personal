Professor: Prof Yap Von Bing

TA: Not very sure

Was not looking forward to taking this module as I was a weak Statistics student. However, I really appreciated Prof Von Bing's efforts in making the content really simple and digestable (though it can be a bit too simple), focusing a lot on the fundamentals of statistics rather than covering a wide range of content that we would forget after a while. I appreciated this approach of conducting the module and actually kind of enjoyed doing statistics for the first time. That being said, I actually wish that more content could have been covered so that we could have learnt more stuff (relevant) in the module.

Workload: 4/10

Difficulty: 4/10

Enjoyability: 5/10

### Canvas Quizzes - 20/20:
There were a total of 23 quizzes, where the best 80% of these quizzes would count towards the component. To encourage lecture attendance, Prof Von Bing activated these quizzes at the end of each lecture session, so most of the people would have attended the lecture in order to attempt the quiz. The quiz were simply 2 questions about the content taught in the lecture, but they were set in a very tricky manner via the use of english. Hence, we have to be very careful about the phrasing of his questions if you want to do well in this component. Again, having friends to sit with and do the quizzes together would really help in scoring full marks for this component.

### Assignment - Not Released/20:
A simple R Programming assignment regarding the content taught in lecture. If I remember correctly, it was just to do a Monte Carlo estimation/simulation of a Gamma/Beta distribution in R, and report the estimated estimators in a report. Doing it with friends would help to cross check your answers and score well for this.

### Tutorial Attendance - 10/10:
You just need to attend at least 8 tutorial session to score full marks for this component.

### Finals - Not Released/50:
Finals were rather simple. As Prof Von Bing said, as long as we understood the lecture content well, this would be rather simple to do. He released a mock paper sometime during Week 13/Reading Week for us to attempt, so as long as you are able to answer those questions, you are good to go.
