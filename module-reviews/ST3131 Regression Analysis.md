# ST3131 Regression Analysis
## Taken in AY23/24 Semester 2

Professor: Prof Yap Von Bing

TA: Not sure

### Assessment Mode:
- Canvas Quiz (15%)
- Assignment (20%)
- Tutorial Attendance (10%)
- Finals (55%)

This module felt more like a sequel to ST2132 Mathematical Statistics since it is being taught by the same prof. I think similar to ST2132 under Prof Von Bing, the content was easily simplified, again with the fundamentals being heavily emphasised. The lecture pace got so slow that he would only go through 5-10 slides per 2 hour lecture session, which made this such a low workload module. One good thing this time is that since the lectures were 8am-10am, Prof Von Bing was very understanding with us and made his lectures 8.15am-9.35am, and the Canvas quizzes lasted the whole day rather than just being at the end of the lecture slot. This did mean that lecture participation dropped significantly, which was a pity as I feel that he is a decent Prof.

Workload: 2/10

Difficulty: 5/10

Enjoyability: 4/10

### Canvas Quiz - 15/15:
Not sure how many quizzes there were, but there were basically 20+ Canvas quizzes, 2 questions each, and the best 90% would be included in the grading for this component. It would help tremendously with friends, since compared to ST2132, you can see the correct answer after you attempt the quiz (meaning with enough friends, you can get the full credit for this component for everyone)

### Assignment - Not Released/20
Again, the Assignment is a R Programming assignment. This time round, we had to create a report depending on what the professor wanted. It was rather difficult if you do not follow his lectures, so make sure to follow his lectures closely (same for the Canvas Quizzes). Again, having friends will help as you can cross check one another.

### Tutorial Attendance - 10/10
Again, just need to attend at least 8 tutorial sessions to get the full marks for this component. Most people will just go into tutorial to clock attendance and do their own things. Though, I felt that the TA was not bad given the nature of the module, and I would have listened more attentively if I could.

### Finals - Not Released/55:
A different format compared to the "prequel", with 25 marks MCQ, 30 marks open-ended questions. The questions were very simple, as it was simply about the content he taught in class, and were similar to his tutorial questions. His questions are worded very purposefully, and you need to understand the key fundamentals of statistics to answer his questions correctly. Again, he released a mock paper sometime during reading week, so as long as you are able to do his questions, you should be good to go.

#### Expected Grade: A
#### Actual Grade: A+
