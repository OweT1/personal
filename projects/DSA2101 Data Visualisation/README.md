# DSA2101 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation

More information about the dataset can be found here: [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-06](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-06)

This project was part of our module, DSA2101 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation, where we had to analyse 1 dataset out of 5 given datasets and provide 3 data visualisations to show the various trends in the data.

For the module, we used R Programming Language and the `tidyverse` package to perform data cleaning, analysis and visualisation. I decided to re-create our project using Python and its packages to practice my Data Visualisation skills.

For the project, I will be creating the following 3 visualisations: 
- `Line Plots` to observe the trends in Population, GDP and Energy Consumption Trends from 1965 to 2018.
- `Bar Plots` to observe the Energy Consumption Trends between the different types of energy sources.
- `Proportional Stacked Area Charts` to observe the Total Energy Consumption Trends between the 'clean' and 'non-clean' energy sources.

More details can be found in the `.ipynb` file. 

The Python Packages used are: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
