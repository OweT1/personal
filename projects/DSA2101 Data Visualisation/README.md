# DSA2101 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation

More information about the dataset can be found here: [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-06](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-06)

This project was part of the module, where we had to analyse a dataset and provide 3 data visualisations to show the trends in the data.

For the module, we used R Programming Language and the `tidyverse` package to perform data cleaning, analysis and visualisation. I decided to use Python and its packages to re-create the project.

Python Packages used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
